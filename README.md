# Project: Button Soccer NFT

## Description

Button football or button soccer is an association football simulation game played on a tabletop, using concave buttons or special-made disks to represent players on the pitch (field), often with a larger rectangular block as the goalkeeper piece.

Board dimensions, markings, and rules of play are modeled to simulate standard football. It is popular in Brazil, as well as various countries in Europe, including Hungary, Georgia and Slovenia.

The goal is to fabricate button soccer teams to start a league to unite parents and children in this craftsmanship adventure.

Each team owner will receive a team of 10 players and 1 goal-keeper crafted by hand in acrylic. Along with the physical soccer team, the owners will also receive a digital certificate of ownership as a non-fungible token (NFT).

A QR code will be visible underneath each player. This code is the unique ID for the player's NFT Certificate.

## Execution Plan

1. **Fabrication of Button Soccer Teams:** Create the button soccer teams by hand. Ensure each team consists of 10 players and 1 goalkeeper. Attach a QR code underneath each player.
2. **Creation of Digital Certificates:** Each digital certificate should be unique and tied to a specific player. The certificate should include key information such as the team name, player's name, player's position, and unique ID (matching the QR code).
3. **Minting of NFTs:** Use a blockchain platform that supports NFTs, such as Ethereum, to mint the NFTs for each player. The NFT should be linked to the digital certificate of ownership.
4. **Distribution to Owners:** Once the button soccer teams are ready and the NFTs are minted, distribute them to the owners. The owners can then scan the QR code to access their digital certificate and NFT.
5. **Community Building:** Start a league and organize matches and tournaments. This will help build a community around the button soccer teams and increase the value of the NFTs.
6. **Marketplace for Trading:** Develop an online platform or marketplace where owners can trade players and teams. This adds another layer of engagement and could potentially increase the value of the NFTs.

## Player Stats Metadata

The NFT metadata for each player could include:

- **Player Name:** The name of the player.
- **Team Name:** The name of the team to which the player belongs.
- **Position:** The player's position in the team.
- **Skill Level:** The player's skill level, potentially determined by game performance.
- **Number of Games Played:** The total number of games the player has participated in.
- **Number of Wins:** The total number of games the player's team has won.
- **Number of Goals:** The total number of goals the player has scored.
- **Unique ID:** A unique identifier for the player. This should match the ID on the physical player piece.

## UX Design Brief for NFT Button Soccer App

### Overview

The NFT Button Soccer App aims to provide an engaging and user-friendly platform for team owners, league organizers, and referees to manage their button soccer teams and leagues. The app should allow users to view and manage their teams and players, track player stats, schedule and participate in tournaments, and trade players and teams.

### User Groups

1. **Team Owners:** These users own one or more button soccer teams. They should be able to view their teams and players, track player stats, participate in tournaments, and trade players and teams.
2. **League Organizers:** These users organize button soccer leagues and tournaments. They should be able to schedule tournaments, manage team registrations, and track team and player stats.
3. **Referees:** These users officiate button soccer matches. They should be able to log match results and player stats.

### Features and Functionality

1. **Team and Player Management:** Users should be able to view and manage their teams and players. This includes viewing player stats and tracking their performance over time.
2. **Tournament Scheduling:** League organizers should be able to schedule tournaments and manage team registrations.
3. **Match Logging:** Referees should be able to log match results and player stats.
4. **Trading Marketplace:** Users should be able to trade players and teams with other users. This could include a bidding system for trades.
5. **NFT Integration:** The app should integrate with the blockchain to support NFT ownership and trading.

### Technology Stack

The app should be developed as a mobile app for iOS and Android, with potential for a web version. It should use a blockchain platform that supports NFTs, such as Ethereum, for the NFT functionality. A peer-to-peer architecture could be used for the trading marketplace to enable direct trades between users.

## Use Cases for Target Users

1. **Team Owner Views Team and Player Stats:** A team owner opens the app to view their teams and players. They can see each player's stats and track their performance over time. They decide to trade one of their players to improve their team.
2. **Team Owner Participates in Tournament:** A team owner registers their team for an upcoming tournament. They participate in the tournament by playing matches against other teams. The results of these matches are logged by referees and the team's stats are updated.
3. **League Organizer Schedules Tournament:** A league organizer schedules a new button soccer tournament. They set the date, time, and rules for the tournament. They then open registrations for teams to participate.
4. **Referee Logs Match Results:** A referee officiates a button soccer match. After the match, they log the result and the players' stats in the app. These stats are then reflected in the teams' and players' records.
5. **User Trades Player:** A user decides to trade one of their players. They list the player in the trading marketplace with a set price. Another user sees the player and decides to purchase them. The trade is facilitated by the app using the underlying blockchain technology to transfer the NFT ownership.

## UX Case Study: Designing the NFT Button Soccer App

### Introduction

The NFT Button Soccer App was envisioned as a platform that would unite parents and children in the craftsmanship adventure of button soccer. The goal was to provide a comprehensive system to manage teams, players, and leagues, complete with NFT-backed player certificates, and a marketplace for trading.

### Research

We started the project by conducting user interviews and surveys to understand the needs and motivations of our target users - team owners, league organizers, and referees.

We then analyzed the data to create user personas that represented the different user types. These personas helped us understand the motivations, goals, and pain points of our users.

### Design Process

Based on our research, we defined user journeys and created the information architecture of the app.
